Error when computing answer for easy-flight-0010: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 1.41 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.55 GiB of which 1.22 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 22.32 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 19.83 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 2.24 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated.

Thought 1: We need to load the flights database.
Action 1: LoadDB[flights]
[Selected action with entropy: 0.25 (best of 2, aggregate: 4.35)]
[Discarded 1 samples with entropies: ['8.45']]
Observation 1: We have successfully loaded the flights database, including the following columns: FlightDate, Airline, Origin, Dest, Cancelled, Diverted, CRSDepTime, DepTime, DepDelayMinutes, DepDelay, ArrTime, ArrDelayMinutes, AirTime, CRSElapsedTime, ActualElapsedTime, Distance, Year, Quarter, Month, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, Marketing_Airline_Network, Operated_or_Branded_Code_Share_Partners, DOT_ID_Marketing_Airline, IATA_Code_Marketing_Airline, Flight_Number_Marketing_Airline, Operating_Airline, DOT_ID_Operating_Airline, IATA_Code_Operating_Airline, Tail_Number, Flight_Number_Operating_Airline, OriginAirportID, OriginAirportSeqID, OriginCityMarketID, OriginCityName, OriginState, OriginStateFips, OriginStateName, OriginWac, DestAirportID, DestAirportSeqID, DestCityMarketID, DestCityName, DestState, DestStateFips, DestStateName, DestWac, DepDel15, DepartureDelayGroups, DepTimeBlk, TaxiOut, WheelsOff, WheelsOn, TaxiIn, CRSArrTime, ArrDelay, ArrDel15, ArrivalDelayGroups, ArrTimeBlk, DistanceGroup, DivAirportLandings.
Thought 2: We need to filter the information related to the q

Error when computing answer for easy-flight-0017: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 1.41 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.55 GiB of which 1.22 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 22.32 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 19.83 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 2.24 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.

Observation 1: We have successfully loaded the flights database, including the following columns: FlightDate, Airline, Origin, Dest, Cancelled, Diverted, CRSDepTime, DepTime, DepDelayMinutes, DepDelay, ArrTime, ArrDelayMinutes, AirTime, CRSElapsedTime, ActualElapsedTime, Distance, Year, Quarter, Month, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, Marketing_Airline_Network, Operated_or_Branded_Code_Share_Partners, DOT_ID_Marketing_Airline, IATA_Code_Marketing_Airline, Flight_Number_Marketing_Airline, Operating_Airline, DOT_ID_Operating_Airline, IATA_Code_Operating_Airline, Tail_Number, Flight_Number_Operating_Airline, OriginAirportID, OriginAirportSeqID, OriginCityMarketID, OriginCityName, OriginState, OriginStateFips, OriginStateName, OriginWac, DestAirportID, DestAirportSeqID, DestCityMarketID, DestCityName, DestState, DestStateFips, DestStateName, DestWac, DepDel15, DepartureDelayGroups, DepTimeBlk, TaxiOut, WheelsOff, WheelsOn, TaxiIn, CRSArrTime, ArrDelay, ArrDel15, ArrivalDelayGroups, ArrTimeBlk, DistanceGroup, DivAirportLandings.
Thought 2: We need to filter the information related to the query
Action 2: FilterDB[Flight_Number_Marketing_Airline=2289, FlightDate=2022-02-20, Origin=MIA, Dest=LAX, Cancelled='Yes']

[Discarded 1 samples with entropies: ['9.97']]
Observation 2: The filtering query Cancelled='Yes' is incorrect. Please modify the condition.
Thought 3: We then need to know the cancelled status.
Action 3: GetValue[Cancelled]
