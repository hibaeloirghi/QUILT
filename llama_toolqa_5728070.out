Error when computing answer for easy-flight-0011: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 1.41 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.55 GiB of which 1.22 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 22.32 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 19.83 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 2.24 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.

Action 1: LoadDB[flights]
[Selected action with entropy: 1.18 (best of 1, aggregate: 1.18)]
Observation 1: We have successfully loaded the flights database, including the following columns: FlightDate, Airline, Origin, Dest, Cancelled, Diverted, CRSDepTime, DepTime, DepDelayMinutes, DepDelay, ArrTime, ArrDelayMinutes, AirTime, CRSElapsedTime, ActualElapsedTime, Distance, Year, Quarter, Month, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, Marketing_Airline_Network, Operated_or_Branded_Code_Share_Partners, DOT_ID_Marketing_Airline, IATA_Code_Marketing_Airline, Flight_Number_Marketing_Airline, Operating_Airline, DOT_ID_Operating_Airline, IATA_Code_Operating_Airline, Tail_Number, Flight_Number_Operating_Airline, OriginAirportID, OriginAirportSeqID, OriginCityMarketID, OriginCityName, OriginState, OriginStateFips, OriginStateName, OriginWac, DestAirportID, DestAirportSeqID, DestCityMarketID, DestCityName, DestState, DestStateFips, DestStateName, DestWac, DepDel15, DepartureDelayGroups, DepTimeBlk, TaxiOut, WheelsOff, WheelsOn, TaxiIn, CRSArrTime, ArrDelay, ArrDel15, ArrivalDelayGroups, ArrTimeBlk, DistanceGroup, DivAirportLandings.
Thought 2: We need to filter the information related to the q

Error when computing answer for easy-flight-0015: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 1.41 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.55 GiB of which 1.22 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 22.32 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 19.83 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 2.24 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated.

============================================================
Processing 17/100: easy-flight-0016
Question: Was the flight WN5333 from RDU to BWI cancelled on 2022-01-08? Only return 'Yes' or 'No'.
============================================================

Running agent...
Thought 1: This is a question related to flights
Action 1: LoadDB[flights]
[Selected action with entropy: 0.67 (best of 1, aggregate: 0.67)]
Observation 1: We have successfully loaded the flights database, including the following columns: FlightDate, Airline, Origin, Dest, Cancelled, Diverted, CRSDepTime, DepTime, DepDelayMinutes, DepDelay, ArrTime, ArrDelayMinutes, AirTime, CRSElapsedTime, ActualElapsedTime, Distance, Year, Quarter, Month, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, Marketing_Airline_Network, Operated_or_Branded_Code_Share_Partners, DOT_ID_Marketing_Airline, IATA_Code_Marketing_Airline, Flight_Number_Marketing_Airline, Operating_Airline, DOT_ID_Operating_Airline, IATA_Code_Operating_Airline, Tail_Number, Flight_Number_Operating_Airline, OriginAirportID, OriginAirportSeqID, OriginCityMarketID, OriginCityName, OriginState, OriginStateFips, OriginStateName, OriginWac, DestAirportID, DestAirportSeqID, DestCityMarketID, DestCityName, DestState, DestStateFips, DestStateName, DestWac, DepDel15, DepartureDelayGroups, DepTimeBlk, TaxiOut, WheelsOff, WheelsOn, TaxiIn, CRSArrTime, ArrDelay, ArrDel15, ArrivalDelayGroups, ArrTimeBlk, DistanceGroup, DivAirportLandings.
Thought 2: We need to filter the information related to the q
Action 2: FilterDB[Flight_Number_Marketing_Airline=5333, FlightDate=2022-01-08, Origin=RDU, Dest=BWI, Cancelled=True]
[Selected action with entropy: 8.24 (best of 1, aggregate: 8.24)]
Observation 2: The filtering query Cancelled=True is incorrect. Please modify the condition.
Thought 3: We then need to know the Cancelled information of the flight.
Action 3: GetValue[Cancelled]

Error when computing answer for easy-flight-0016: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 1.41 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.55 GiB of which 1.22 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 22.32 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 19.83 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 2.24 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.

============================================================
Processing 18/100: easy-flight-0017
Question: Was the flight WN2465 from SAN to DEN cancelled on 2022-01-10? Only return 'Yes' or 'No'.
============================================================

Running agent...
Thought 1: This is a question related to flights
Action 1: LoadDB[flights]
[Selected action with entropy: 4.37 (best of 1, aggregate: 4.37)]
Observation 1: We have successfully loaded the flights database, including the following columns: FlightDate, Airline, Origin, Dest, Cancelled, Diverted, CRSDepTime, DepTime, DepDelayMinutes, DepDelay, ArrTime, ArrDelayMinutes, AirTime, CRSElapsedTime, ActualElapsedTime, Distance, Year, Quarter, Month, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, Marketing_Airline_Network, Operated_or_Branded_Code_Share_Partners, DOT_ID_Marketing_Airline, IATA_Code_Marketing_Airline, Flight_Number_Marketing_Airline, Operating_Airline, DOT_ID_Operating_Airline, IATA_Code_Operating_Airline, Tail_Number, Flight_Number_Operating_Airline, OriginAirportID, OriginAirportSeqID, OriginCityMarketID, OriginCityName, OriginState, OriginStateFips, OriginStateName, OriginWac, DestAirportID, DestAirportSeqID, DestCityMarketID, DestCityName, DestState, DestStateFips, DestStateName, DestWac, DepDel15, DepartureDelayGroups, DepTimeBlk, TaxiOut, WheelsOff, WheelsOn, TaxiIn, CRSArrTime, ArrDelay, ArrDel15, ArrivalDelayGroups, ArrTimeBlk, DistanceGroup, DivAirportLandings.
Thought 2: We need to filter the information related to the q
Action 2: FilterDB[Flight_Number_Marketing_Airline=2465, FlightDate=2022-01-10, Origin=SAN, Dest=DEN, Cancelled=True]
[Selected action with entropy: 25.03 (best of 1, aggregate: 25.03)]
Observation 2: The filtering query Cancelled=True is incorrect. Please modify the condition.
Thought 3: We need to check the Cancelled value
Action 3: GetValue[Cancelled]
