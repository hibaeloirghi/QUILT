Question: Was the flight DL5097 from MLU to ATL cancelled on 2022-02-05? Only return 'Yes' or 'No'.
============================================================

Running agent...
Thought 1: The question is asking the cancellation status of a flight
Action 1: LoadDB[flights]
[Selected action with entropy: 0.39 (best of 5, aggregate: 1.94)]
[Discarded 4 samples with entropies: ['4.24', '0.39', '2.35', '2.35']]
Observation 1: We have successfully loaded the flights database, including the following columns: FlightDate, Airline, Origin, Dest, Cancelled, Diverted, CRSDepTime, DepTime, DepDelayMinutes, DepDelay, ArrTime, ArrDelayMinutes, AirTime, CRSElapsedTime, ActualElapsedTime, Distance, Year, Quarter, Month, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, Marketing_Airline_Network, Operated_or_Branded_Code_Share_Partners, DOT_ID_Marketing_Airline, IATA_Code_Marketing_Airline, Flight_Number_Marketing_Airline, Operating_Airline, DOT_ID_Operating_Airline, IATA_Code_Operating_Airline, Tail_Number, Flight_Number_Operating_Airline, OriginAirportID, OriginAirportSeqID, OriginCityMarketID, OriginCityName, OriginState, OriginStateFips, OriginStateName, OriginWac, DestAirportID, DestAirportSeqID, DestCityMarketID, DestCityName, DestState, DestStateFips, DestStateName, DestWac, DepDel15, DepartureDelayGroups, DepTimeBlk, TaxiOut, WheelsOff, WheelsOn, TaxiIn, CRSArrTime, ArrDelay, ArrDel15, ArrivalDelayGroups, ArrTimeBlk, DistanceGroup, DivAirportLandings.
Thought 2: We need to filter the information related to the q
Action 2: FilterDB[Flight_Number_Marketing_Airline=5097, FlightDate=2022-02-05, Origin=MLU, Dest=ATL, Cancelled=True]
[Selected action with entropy: 4.06 (best of 5, aggregate: 15.70)]
[Discarded 4 samples with entropies: ['9.29', '22.26', '7.52', '35.36']]
Observation 2: The filtering query Cancelled=True is incorrect. Please modify the condition.
Thought 3: We need to modify the condition.
Action 3: FilterDB[Flight_Number_Marketing_Airline=5097, FlightDate=2022-02-05, Origin=MLU, Dest=ATL, Cancelled=False]
[Selected action with entropy: 3.28 (best of 5, aggregate: 17.49)]
[Discarded 4 samples with entropies: ['29.32', '16.36', '15.24', '23.24']]
Observation 3: We have successfully filtered the data (1 rows).
Thought 4: The query Cancelled=False returns 1 row, so the flight DL5097 was not cancelled.
Action 4: Finish[No]
[Selected action with entropy: 11.46 (best of 5, aggregate: 15.09)]

Error when computing answer for easy-flight-0026: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 1.41 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.55 GiB of which 1.22 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 22.32 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 19.83 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 2.24 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
