Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps. Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be 13 types: 
(1) Calculate[formula], which calculates the formula and returns the result.
(2) RetrieveAgenda[keyword], which retrieves the agenda related to keyword.
(3) RetrieveScirex[keyword], which retrieves machine learning papers' paragraphs related to keyword.
(4) LoadDB[DBName], which loads the database DBName and returns the database. The DBName can be one of the following: flights/coffee/airbnb/yelp.
(5) FilterDB[condition], which filters the database DBName by the column column_name the relation (e.g., =, >, etc.) and the value value, and returns the filtered database.
(6) GetValue[column_name], which returns the value of the column column_name in the database DBName.
(7) LoadGraph[GraphName], which loads the graph GraphName and returns the graph. The GraphName can be one of the following: PaperNet/AuthorNet.
(8) NeighbourCheck[GraphName, Node], which lists the neighbours of the node Node in the graph GraphName and returns the neighbours. 
(9) NodeCheck[GraphName, Node], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node. 
(10) EdgeCheck[GraphName, Node1, Node2], which returns the detailed attribute information of the edge between Node1 and Node2. 
(11) SQLInterpreter[SQL], which interprets the SQL query SQL and returns the result.
(12) PythonInterpreter[Python], which interprets the Python code Python and returns the result.
(13) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Question: What was the departure time of the AA2319 flight from MIA to LAS on 2022-06-05? Only return the time in HH:MM format.
Thought 1: We need to load the flights database.
Action 1: LoadDB[flights]
Observation 1: We have successfully loaded the flights database, including the following columns: FlightDate, Airline, Origin, Dest, Cancelled, Diverted, CRSDepTime, DepTime, DepDelayMinutes, DepDelay, ArrTime, ArrDelayMinutes, AirTime, CRSElapsedTime, ActualElapsedTime, Distance, Year, Quarter, Month, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, Marketing_Airline_Network, Operated_or_Branded_Code_Share_Partners, DOT_ID_Marketing_Airline, IATA_Code_Marketing_Airline, Flight_Number_Marketing_Airline, Operating_Airline, DOT_ID_Operating_Airline, IATA_Code_Operating_Airline, Tail_Number, Flight_Number_Operating_Airline, OriginAirportID, OriginAirportSeqID, OriginCityMarketID, OriginCityName, OriginState, OriginStateFips, OriginStateName, OriginWac, DestAirportID, DestAirportSeqID, DestCityMarketID, DestCityName, DestState, DestStateFips, DestStateName, DestWac, DepDel15, DepartureDelayGroups, DepTimeBlk, TaxiOut, WheelsOff, WheelsOn, TaxiIn, CRSArrTime, ArrDelay, ArrDel15, ArrivalDelayGroups, ArrTimeBlk, DistanceGroup, DivAirportLandings.
Thought 2: We then need to filter the information related to the query.
Action 2: FilterDB[Flight_Number_Marketing_Airline=2319, FlightDate=2022-06-05, Origin=MIA, Dest=LAS]
Observation 2: We have successfully filtered the data (1 rows).
Thought 3: We then need to know the departure time.
Action 3: GetValue[DepTime]
Observation 3: 2143.0
Thought 4: To get the time in HH:MM format, we need to conver
Action 4: Calculate[strftime('%H:%M', datetime(2022, 6, 5, 21, 43, 0))]
Observation 4: Illegal Mathematical Expression. Please try again.
Thought 5: After calculation, we know that the answer is 21:43.
Action 5: Finish[21:43]
Observation 5: Answer is CORRECT
Correct answer: 21:43
