Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps. Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be 13 types: 
(1) Calculate[formula], which calculates the formula and returns the result.
(2) RetrieveAgenda[keyword], which retrieves the agenda related to keyword.
(3) RetrieveScirex[keyword], which retrieves machine learning papers' paragraphs related to keyword.
(4) LoadDB[DBName], which loads the database DBName and returns the database. The DBName can be one of the following: flights/coffee/airbnb/yelp.
(5) FilterDB[condition], which filters the database DBName by the column column_name the relation (e.g., =, >, etc.) and the value value, and returns the filtered database.
(6) GetValue[column_name], which returns the value of the column column_name in the database DBName.
(7) LoadGraph[GraphName], which loads the graph GraphName and returns the graph. The GraphName can be one of the following: PaperNet/AuthorNet.
(8) NeighbourCheck[GraphName, Node], which lists the neighbours of the node Node in the graph GraphName and returns the neighbours. 
(9) NodeCheck[GraphName, Node], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node. 
(10) EdgeCheck[GraphName, Node1, Node2], which returns the detailed attribute information of the edge between Node1 and Node2. 
(11) SQLInterpreter[SQL], which interprets the SQL query SQL and returns the result.
(12) PythonInterpreter[Python], which interprets the Python code Python and returns the result.
(13) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Question: How long was the different between the CRS recorded departure time and actual departure time of the DL3826 flight from LAX to ABQ on 2022-06-15? Only return the number of minutes.
Thought 1: This is a question related to flights
Action 1: LoadDB[flights]
Observation 1: We have successfully loaded the flights database, including the following columns: FlightDate, Airline, Origin, Dest, Cancelled, Diverted, CRSDepTime, DepTime, DepDelayMinutes, DepDelay, ArrTime, ArrDelayMinutes, AirTime, CRSElapsedTime, ActualElapsedTime, Distance, Year, Quarter, Month, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, Marketing_Airline_Network, Operated_or_Branded_Code_Share_Partners, DOT_ID_Marketing_Airline, IATA_Code_Marketing_Airline, Flight_Number_Marketing_Airline, Operating_Airline, DOT_ID_Operating_Airline, IATA_Code_Operating_Airline, Tail_Number, Flight_Number_Operating_Airline, OriginAirportID, OriginAirportSeqID, OriginCityMarketID, OriginCityName, OriginState, OriginStateFips, OriginStateName, OriginWac, DestAirportID, DestAirportSeqID, DestCityMarketID, DestCityName, DestState, DestStateFips, DestStateName, DestWac, DepDel15, DepartureDelayGroups, DepTimeBlk, TaxiOut, WheelsOff, WheelsOn, TaxiIn, CRSArrTime, ArrDelay, ArrDel15, ArrivalDelayGroups, ArrTimeBlk, DistanceGroup, DivAirportLandings.
Thought 2: We need to filter the information related to the q
Action 2: FilterDB[Flight_Number_Marketing_Airline=3826, FlightDate=2022-06-15, Origin=LAX, Dest=ABQ]
Observation 2: We have successfully filtered the data (1 rows).
Thought 3: We then need to know the CRS recorded departure time
Action 3: GetValue[CRSDepTime]
Observation 3: 1910
Thought 4: We then need to know the actual departure time
Action 4: GetValue[DepTime]
Observation 4: 1904.0
Thought 5: To compute the different between the CRS recorded departure time and actual departure time, we need to subtract the actual departure time from the CRS recorded departure time
